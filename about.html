				<h3>Make Things</h3>
				<p>
					The goal of Full Stack Furniture is to make beautiful and functional things without committing to any one style, material, or process, proving to the average person that they too can make.
				</p>
				<h3>Who's behind it all?</h3>
				<p>
					I'm Bill Wanamaker and before I was a maker, I was a breaker. I would take apart anything just to see what was inside and how it worked. As I got older, I learned about computer programming, basic home repair, welding, and more recently, how to stay busy in-between jobs. I'm always looking for new things to try to make. I don't care about being the best at any one thing, but I love the feeling of completing something that I didn't know I could do. I want others to experience that feeling as well.
				</p>
				<h3>Where do you come in?</h3>
				<p>
					I'm always looking for new ideas. Product ideas, design ideas, material ideas. I never limit myself by sticking with the things I've already made and am comfortable with. Let me know what you'd like to see! I would also love for you to start or continue making. I want to be a resource for you. I love talking about the lessons I've learned and helping others avoid mistakes I've already made. Don't hesitate to ask!
