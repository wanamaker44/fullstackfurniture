						<h3>oak desk</h3>
						<p>
							I recently watched a video of a guy in Japan travel to a well-known furniture maker's shop to meet with him multiple times as the artisan built a custom desk. Ultimately, the desk didn't look all that flashy or exciting, but the joy that the customer showed upon seeing each step turned out to be very powerful for the maker to see, and he explained that he normally doesn't get to see the customer actually receive his products. Anyway, watching the video inspired me to build something simple, but more slowly than normal. I've found that in making things, I often rush through the steps that I've done before to get to the interesting, new steps that I've never done. This often means that I don't get any better at the "boring" steps, and my final products show it. In the video I refered to, this furniture maker has been building furniture for longer than I've been alive, and yet this simple desk that he built took multiple months. Some of the reason for that is his understanding of how wood needs to adjust to the changes he was making to it, but I'm sure at least some of the reason is just knowing that patience pays off. I could almost see it in the final product. Nothing flashy, nothing really new, but a beautiful, elegant desk that the customer was thrilled with. I'd like to experience even just a small part of that in building this oak desk.

						<h3>apothecary style cabinet</h3>
						<p>
							Building this cabinet challenged me in many ways, but overall I'm very happy with the result. Only about $20 in materials, probably 10 hours of work, and I'm sure I could do it again in much less. Success all around. Watch the video!
